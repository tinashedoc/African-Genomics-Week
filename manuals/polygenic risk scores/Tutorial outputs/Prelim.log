Initializing Genotype file: ASN (bed) 

Start processing ASN.gwasqc 
================================================== 

Base file: ASN.gwasqc.txt 
Header of file is: 
CHR	BP	SNP	A1	A2	N	SE	P	OR	INFO	MAF 

529502 variant(s) observed in base file, with: 
264745 variant(s) with INFO score less than 0.900000 
14838 ambiguous variant(s) excluded 
249919 total variant(s) included from base file 

Loading Genotype info from target 
================================================== 

503 people (240 male(s), 263 female(s)) observed 
252 founder(s) included 

Warning: Currently not support haploid chromosome and sex 
         chromosomes 

279583 variant(s) not found in previous data 
39 variant(s) with mismatch information 
249880 variant(s) included 

Phenotype file: ASN.pheno 
Column Name of Sample ID: FID+IID 
Note: If the phenotype file does not contain a header, the 
column name will be displayed as the Sample ID which is 
expected. 

There are a total of 1 phenotype to process 

Start performing clumping 

Number of variant(s) after clumping : 131186 

Processing the 1 th phenotype 

Pheno is a continuous phenotype 
12 sample(s) without phenotype 
240 sample(s) with valid phenotype 

Processing the covariate file: ASN.cov 
============================== 

Include Covariates: 
Name	Missing	Number of levels 
Sex	0	- 

After reading the covariate file, 240 sample(s) included in 
the analysis 

There are 1 region(s) with p-value less than 1e-5. Please 
note that these results are inflated due to the overfitting 
inherent in finding the best-fit PRS (but it's still best 
to find the best-fit PRS!). 
You can use the --perm option (see manual) to calculate an 
empirical P-value.
