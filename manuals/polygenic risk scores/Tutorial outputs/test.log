Warning: By selecting --keep-ambig, PRSice assume the base 
         and target are reporting alleles on the same 
         strand and will therefore only perform dosage flip 
         for the ambiguous SNPs. If you are unsure of what 
         the strand is, then you should not select the 
         --keep-ambig option 

Initializing Genotype file: ASN (bed) 

Start processing Bestprs_disc 
================================================== 

Base file: Bestprs_disc 
Header of file is: 
CHR BP SNP A1 A2 N SE P OR INFO MAF 

133903 variant(s) observed in base file, with: 
133903 total variant(s) included from base file 

Loading Genotype info from target 
================================================== 

503 people (240 male(s), 263 female(s)) observed 
251 founder(s) included 

Warning: Currently not support haploid chromosome and sex 
         chromosomes 

395599 variant(s) not found in previous data 
133903 variant(s) included 

Phenotype file: ASN.pheno 
Column Name of Sample ID: FID+IID 
Note: If the phenotype file does not contain a header, the 
column name will be displayed as the Sample ID which is 
expected. 

There are a total of 1 phenotype to process 

Processing the 1 th phenotype 

Pheno is a continuous phenotype 
16 sample(s) without phenotype 
235 sample(s) with valid phenotype 

Processing the covariate file: ASN.cov 
============================== 

Include Covariates: 
Name	Missing	Number of levels 
Sex	0	- 

After reading the covariate file, 235 sample(s) included in 
the analysis 

There are 1 region(s) with p-value less than 1e-5. Please 
note that these results are inflated due to the overfitting 
inherent in finding the best-fit PRS (but it's still best 
to find the best-fit PRS!). 
You can use the --perm option (see manual) to calculate an 
empirical P-value.
