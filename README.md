# African Genomics Week

Genomics Data Science Training Program by AfSHG and SFI Ireland 14-18 November 2022

## Course overview
The African Society of Human Genetics was established in 2003 with the central goal of building capacity of the African scientific community and policymakers to contribute to the field of genetics research and to attract global attention to African genomic research and researchers. Almost two decades later, the AfSHG members have contributed to the expansion of the Genomics Research field in Africa. This workshop will introduce participants to African Genetic Diversity through webinars from a select number of AfSHG members (please note, the webinars will be open to the public). These talks will be solidified by background lectures, some case studies and hands-on tutorial sessions to introduce and highlight some key areas of research and provide some practical examples/exercises for participants to work on.
